Caffeine-projects for 40+ Secoinfi-Apps

# App Specification: Crowd-AI-Fund
**Platform Goal**: Attract Seed-funds from all cohorts including Retail Investors, Angel Investors, Sponsors, VCs of Conglomerates, NGOs, and Government bodies.
**Domain**: `*.caffeine.xyz`
**System Architecture**: Modular, Scalable, Resilient, Robust, De-centralized.
**Support & Real-time Fixes**: https://caffeine.ai/chat/019c7f90-3277-73fc-84ba-d24e3aaf20f8

## Core Technical Directives (50-Credit Bound)
- **AI Instruction Constraint**: Strict 50-credit limit for AI generation; instructions must remain strictly modular and pointwise.
- **Investment Tracking Engine**: 
  - Track all Investors & Investments sequentially using a Merkle Root coupled with a cryptographic Nonce.
  - **Session Memory**: Maintain exactly the last 6 transaction hashes in active memory/session for instant verification and rollback capabilities.
  - **State Persistence**: Store and commit the Final Merkle-Root Hash securely to the backend immediately prior to any logouts by Users, Subscribers, Investors, or Admins.
- **Fixture Pre-population**: Incorporate the consolidated Pros, Functions, and Features from the 40+ legacy `caffeine-projects` as backend fixtures upon initialization.
