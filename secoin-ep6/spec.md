# SECoin Property Investment Platform

## Overview
A property investment platform that enables fractional ownership of real estate properties with dynamic node-based property subscriptions, real-time price updates, comprehensive content management, advanced navigation features, cryptographic data integrity verification through enhanced Fixtures system, and a comprehensive AI-actionable realty business blog system. Properties are publicly viewable with interactive map features and subscriber-based property listing capabilities with dynamic node management. The platform includes enterprise-grade reliability, scalability, and audit-ready operational features with structured logging, failure containment, and performance optimization.

## Schema Architecture
- Primary specification source: spec.yaml as the authoritative schema for all modules
- YAML parsing enabled in backend loader with validation against defined modules: authentication, storage, nodes, images, audit, billing, blog, referrals, sitemap, gallery, faq, frontend, operations, and performance-monitoring
- Anchors and $ref references implemented in parser to avoid duplication and ensure DRY schema management
- Execution model reads and caches each module once, with all downstream services referencing normalized YAML keys instead of re-parsing prose
- Fallback hierarchy: spec.yaml → spec.json → spec.md (only when YAML/JSON unavailable, with performance degradation warnings)
- Admin notifications on successful spec.yaml load: "✅ YAML spec loaded successfully. All modules active. Source: spec.yaml. Mode: deduplicated, unit-safe."
- Fallback warning when spec.md is used: "⚠️ spec.md fallback in use. Performance may be degraded."
- All modules (property management, node import, audit logging, billing, etc.) reference the normalized YAML/JSON schema
- Enhanced performance monitoring module in spec.yaml for tracking degraded performance states and admin notifications
- Future-proofing section in YAML schema for updates, upgrades, modifications, and migrations with explicit error prevention
- Automatic conversion system from spec.md to spec.yaml when YAML format is not present, setting it as the canonical specification
- Backend loader configuration to check for spec.yaml existence and activate it as the authoritative schema
- Robust schema migration system ensuring seamless transition from markdown to YAML format with data integrity preservation
- Proactive performance monitoring with automated degraded performance prevention and admin notifications
- Enhanced spec.yaml loader with robust fallback handling for all future updates, upgrades, migrations, or modifications
- System health monitoring with proactive performance optimization and degraded mode prevention
