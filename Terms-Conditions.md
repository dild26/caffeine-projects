# Terms and Conditions: Fractional Ownership & SECOIN Distribution

These Terms and Conditions legally govern the fractional ownership, token distribution, and collaborative responsibilities regarding the 40+ applications hosted under **Secoinfi-Apps** (`caffeine-projects`), managed by **Sudha Enterprises**.

## 1. Equal Equity Principle
1.1. **Absolute Equality:** Sudha Enterprises strictly enforces a model of absolute equality. All network participants—including Users, Subscribers, Developers, Investors, and Administrators—maintain equal legal, voting, and existential standing within the ecosystem's fractional ownership structure.
1.2. **Bridging the Digital Divide:** This structure is fundamentally designed to bridge the digital divide, ensuring that capital output and digital assets are proportionally distributed based on value creation rather than legacy capital investment.

## 2. Fractional Ownership via GitHub Commits
2.1. **Code-to-Equity Conversion:** A Developer's fractional ownership is directly proportional to the percentage of high-quality, approved code committed to the `caffeine-projects` GitHub repository relative to the total codebase data.
2.2. **Metrics & Approval:** Only commits that pass quality assurance, security audits, and are merged into the main operational branches count towards fractional equity.
2.3. **Dynamic Recalculation:** Fractional ownership percentages organically recalculate as the overall codebase expands.

## 3. SECOIN Remuneration
3.1. **The Asset:** Remuneration for fractional ownership is distributed in **SECOIN**, a proprietary crypto-coin/asset driving `#cryptoRealty` projects and the broader Secoinfi-Apps ecosystem.
3.2. **Vesting & Payouts:** SECOIN distributions are tied to a "Goal/Target Set to Get" approach. Payouts are executed upon the successful completion of time-bound project targets.
3.3. **Valuation:** The value of SECOIN is subject to market dynamics, decentralized exchange rates, and the overall adoption of the Secoinfi-Apps ecosystem. Sudha Enterprises makes no guarantees regarding fiat exchange stability.

## 4. Developer Responsibilities
4.1. **Target-Bound Upgrades:** Developers voluntarily agree to participate in time-bound sprints and commit to upgrading designated applications (out of the 40+ apps available) within specified deadlines.
4.2. **Quality Assurance:** Developers must ensure that all code contributed is free of malicious intent, security loopholes, and respects open-source guidelines.
4.3. **Intellectual Property:** By committing code to `caffeine-projects` for SECOIN remuneration, the Developer agrees that the code becomes part of the shared, decentralized Secoinfi asset pool. Original authorship is tracked on-chain and via GitHub, backing the fractional ownership claim.

## 5. Dispute Resolution
5.1. Any disputes arising from code valuation, commit percentages, or SECOIN distribution will be resolved through a transparent, community-driven decentralized consensus mechanism, supplemented by arbitration in Bangalore, India, if necessary.
